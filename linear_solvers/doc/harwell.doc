 MA28 consists of four user callable routines for the solution of 
 sparse linear equations where the coefficient matrix may be 
 unsymmetric and numerical pivoting may be required for stability.  A 
 call to MA28AD must precede a call to MA28BD and a call to MA28AD or 
 MA28BD must precede a call to MA28CD or MA28ID.  The BLOCK DATA 
 subprograms contained in the files blkdta000.f, blkdta001.f, and 
 blkdta002.f initialize COMMON data and need to be linked with the 
 other routines.
     
 Most of the Harwell Subroutine Library routines are in Fortran 77.  A 
 few are in Fortran 90. There are many packages for the solution of 
 sparse linear and nonlinear equations (including MA48, which 
 supersedes MA28).  Further details can be found on WWW page:
        http://www.dci.clrc.ac.uk/Activity.asp?HSL

 The MA28 package is not in the public domain. It is part of the 
 Harwell Subroutine Library, which is a general library of mathematical 
 subroutines written in Fortran.  A researcher may use MA28 without 
 charge SOLELY for research purposes.  For details of how to obtain

Subject: Availability of HSL mathematical software

HSL (formerly the Harwell Subroutine Library)

We are delighted to announce the availability of many of our codes to
the numerical analysis community.  The details are below.

Our codes and Web sites should be in place by Tuesday October 3rd.

The commercial version of HSL 2000 will be launched by AEA Technology
on October 16th.

HSL 2000
========

HSL (formerly the Harwell Subroutine Library) is a collection of ISO
Fortran  codes  for  large  scale  scientific computation written by
members of the  Numerical  Analysis  Group  at  Rutherford  Appleton
Laboratory  and  by  other experts and collaborators. As the Library
has evolved, many of the older  packages  have  been  superseded  by
newer   versions,   with   increases   in   functionality,  improved
interfaces, or speed of execution.  From October 2000, HSL  will  be
divided  into two parts, the main library, HSL 2000; and an archive,
HSL Archive. The HSL Archive comprises  packages  that  have  either
been superseded by more modern codes, or that we no longer feel able
to support. Many new packages are to be introduced as  part  of  the
release   of   HSL  2000.   These  include  new  sparse  matrix  and
optimization codes and new codes for use on parallel computers.


Free use of HSL 2000 by UK academics
------------------------------------

While HSL 2000 continues to be  a  commercial  product,  it  is  now
freely available for UK academics (those whose email address ends in
.ac.uk, and who access the codes from a .ac.uk machine) for academic
research or teaching purposes. This innovation is a direct result of
much of the  core funding for the Group  being  provided by a  grant
from EPSRC (GR/M78502).


Free academic use of HSL Archive by everyone
--------------------------------------------

In addition, the HSL Archive is now freely available to  anyone  (UK
and  elsewhere), so long as the codes are not then incorporated into
a commercial product; no support is associated with free  access  to
the HSL Archive.


How to access the codes
-----------------------

Access is by way of the HSL WWW page

 http://www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/Activity/HSL

Access to both HSL 2000 (for .ac.uk) and  the  HSL  Archive  are  by
means   of   short-lived  individual  password-controlled  accounts.
Potential users are asked for brief details of the use  they  intend
to  make  of  the  package(s)  they aim to download.  Users are also
asked to accept a conditions-of-use form, and are not  permitted  to
divulge  their userid and password to anyone else, nor to distribute
any codes they obtain to a third party.

Information on the commercial use of HSL 2000 can be found by  links
from the above Web page.
