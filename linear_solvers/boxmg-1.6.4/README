         Black Box Multigrid for (2D and 3D) Symmetric Problems


     This package contains a version of Black Box Multigrid for
  symmetric 2D problems [1,2] that has been tested on a wide variety
  of machines.  The codes are suitable for 9-point discretizations of
  elliptic PDEs.  Specifically there are two versions of Black Box
  Multigrid for 2D problems in this package.  The first, which is
  dicussed in detail in [1], is suitable for 9-point discretizations
  of elliptic PDEs with combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin
  boundary conditions (i.e., positive definite matrices).  The second
  [2], accomodates 9-point discretizations of elliptic PDEs that
  generate a semi-definite matrix (e.g., periodic boundary
  conditions).  In both cases the user is only required to provide the
  fine-grid stencil, the discrete right hand side and an initial
  guess. The code generates all coarse-grid and intergrid transfer
  operators.

     Also this package contains a version of Black Box Multigrid for
  symmetric 3D problems [3] that hasn't been tested much yet.  It was
  developed on the CRAY-YMP and has barely seen the light of day
  since.  This is the first alpha release to merge the 3D code with
  the more widely tested 2D code (which is used for plane relaxation)
  and is part of an ongoing port/update of this code.  It is suitable
  for 7-, 15- and 27-point discretizations of second order
  self-adjoint elliptic PDEs on logically rectangular grids (e.g.,
  tensor product grids).  It is possible to treat both vertex- and
  cell-based discretizations provided the underlying structure is
  consistent with a logically rectangular grid.

     There should be very little trouble in porting this set of codes
  to differnt platforms.  Current configuration includes Linux/Intel
  Linux/Alpha, IRIX/R10K and Solaris/UltraSparc.
