===============================================================================

  This extras subdirectory contains versions of the BLAS and LAPACK
  that we use with Black Box Multigrid [1,2].  In addition there is a
  random number generator that is used by one of our examples. These
  routines are provided to make configuring and testing the Black Box
  Multigrid library easier.  They are freely available from netlib,

    http://www.netlib.org/

  The versions that we've included here have been modified slightly to
  improve portability (in our opinion).  These modifications should be
  benign but there is absolutely no guarentee, either written or
  implied, that this is the case (see license for the usual legal
  stuff).  Finally, we have also included our machine-dependent timing
  routine (i.e., wrapper) BMG_timer.
