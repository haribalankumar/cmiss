Harwell:

The ma28ad() solver is an old code. As part of the SL license it is
available for free use to academics provided it is not incorperated
into a commercial product.

Umfpack is available for educational, research, and benchmarking purposes 
by non-profit organizations and the U.S. government. Comercial usage
requires use of the ma38() routines in HSL, which requires purchase
of a license.
