The previous version, AMG1R5 is described as "widely available to the
public" by M. BREZINA, A. J. CLEARY, R. D. FALGOUT, V. E. HENSON, J. E. JONES,
T. A. MANTEUFFEL, S. F. MCCORMICK, AND J. W. RUGE, in "ALGEBRAIC MULTIGRID
BASED ON ELEMENT INTERPOLATION (AMGe)", SIAM J. SCI. COMPUT., Vol. 22, No. 5,
pp. 1570-1592, and john w. ruge is one of the authors of amg1r6.

The other possibly principal author seems to be Klaus Stuben of
Fraunhofer-Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing (SCAI), Sankt
Augustin, Germany.

The code no longer seems to be distributed and has been superceded by SAMG
(http://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/SAMG.htm).

It seems there may have been "Free AMG1R5 Research Software License Agreement"
making the software available freely only for research purposes.
