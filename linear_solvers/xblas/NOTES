From where did these files come?

(The routines do not appear to resemble xblas from cmlib.)

(pblas of scalapack is written in C and is for distributed memory programs so
these routines are not related to that package.)

pdasum pdaxpy pdcopy pddot pdscal pdnrm2 have comments suggesting that they
came from the reference blas implementation but the code is quite different
(rewritten?).

pdamax may have been adapted from blas.

dload and pdload may have been adapted from blas dcopy.

icopy appears to have been created by Stuart Norris.
