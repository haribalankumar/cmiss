With the splitting up of *.ipmate files for simple ionic current
models and grid problems, a new ipcell file will be created with the
same name as the ipmate file but all comfiles must be changed
manually for the new ipcell file to be read in.

Note that the script to do the splitting, ipcellipmate.sh,
only works IF THE PARAMETERS ARE CONSTANT SPATIALLY. Otherwise
a manual split up is needed.
