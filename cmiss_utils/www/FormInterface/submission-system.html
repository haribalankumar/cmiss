<UL>
<LI> Most of the CMISS examples have been designed for interactive use,
     and rely on outputing information to a GX window. In remote batch
     mode this will not work. Commands such as "open window"and "draw",
     as well as anything else that may do any graphics may be
     left in the comfile. However CMISS cannot use these commands
     since the display isn't set and X windows cannot initialize itself
     in those circumstances.<P>

<LI> The CMGUI action button requires the hpc_cmgui shell script 
     to be set up as a Helper Application in Netscape. Set the MIME type as 
     "application/x-cmgui", with the application being "hpc_cmgui.sh %s".
     <P>
     On the Bioengineering system the shell script is located at 
     "$CMISS_ROOT/www/webcmiss/hpc_cmgui.sh". Remote users should
     downloaded the script from <a href="hpc_cmgui.sh">here</a>.
     They will also need to download a cmgui executable for their system.
