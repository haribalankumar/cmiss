Call Tree
=========

The program in this directory take a list of fortran files and generate
the calling tree information for the subroutines. Comments (both column
zero as well as "!" based ones) are handled. Call that are broken over
more than one line (continuations) are handled. Strings that appear to
be subrouytine calls within quotations (strings) are handled.

The data that is collected is then merged with the "database" of 
existing information about the subroutines and written back to disc.
