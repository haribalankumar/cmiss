This directory contains the program that parses the output from
Fortran Check's CMISS diagnostics, and cross references them with
the actual common files used in CMISS to determine actual common
file errors. This information is output to an HTML file that can
be read from our Server.



Work To Do
==========

The code works fine, and the only work required is in tidying up the
source, and breaking the parser.c file into more logically discrete
chunks (each object having a seperate file, and thus guanteed interface).
