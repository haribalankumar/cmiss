The directory consists of a set of subdirectories, all forming the CMISS
information managment tools. These tools extract information from various
places (including the CMISS source) and output data for use with our WWW
Information Server. Some tolls simply output HTML based on the files they
inspect, whereas other tools are placed on out WWW Information Server and
allow client-server style lookup of relevant CMISS information (including
browsing the source, looking at and loading of example command files,
and allowing feedback, for example via a FORM based "Changes" file.

Some of the tools need to inspect the source every night (or as required)
in order to generate up to date information, as well as making local
files to lookup information (as parsing the 8+ Meg of Fortran source in
CMISS each time information was requested would be impractical in terms
of time and load on the server).



CMISS Root Notes

================



The CMISS root causes some headaches as it is easy for shell scripts to
determine whether or not an environment variable is set and react
accordingly (and this is vital for testing code before putting into
"production use"), but there is more of a problem when it comes to both
Makefiles (and specifically installing binaries) and CGI programs.
Makefiles are not set up to inquire whether variables are set or not (the
only option of any use being -e on the command line, which unfortunately
breaks *all* overriden vars and not just the ones you may need). CGI
programs on the other hand are not invoked by users, but rather by
daemons, and the passing of environment vars cannot be guaranteed (and
may be hard to set up on a machine without full priviledges anyway).

The solution is to ignore both these items for now, and make the
programmer responable for changing them when the need arises.



Work To Do
==========

Lots - all the source need to use the same utility routines and not 
their own local copies. Error handling varies from Good to Woefully
Inadequate. Test code should be written to at least ensure basic
functionality in each module and tool.
