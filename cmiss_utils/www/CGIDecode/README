This directory contains the source for a simple library that allows CGI
clients to isolate themselves from the grubby details of obtaining
the CGI data via GET or POST, and from having to detail with 
url-encoded data.

Version
=======

0.2 - This needs a lot of work before it would be "releaseable". Even so
      it does the job when used properly.



Work To Do
==========

disposeCGI(), general Fix'N'Tidy. Cope with empty pair better. Test
under more extreme conditions. Make portable to more than just an
SGI. Fill out CGI fields for client use. Add more support for
differing input (INPUT type, FORM based maps, etc).
