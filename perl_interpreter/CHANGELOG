This software is the perl_interpreter for CMISS.
It is released under the Mozilla Public License v1.1

Further information, help pages, a tracker and a wiki is available at 
http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/

v2.0.0
First open source release.  License updated to Mozilla Public License.
Added README, INSTALL, RELEASE_NOTES and CHANGELOG.

v2.0.1
adding Darwin support
Include utilities/pm2pmh which was missing in the previous release.
Provide DynaLoader pm module, so that it is the same version as the library
  linked against.
Search for a binary compatible libperl.so based on api_versionstring and
  compilation options instead of perl archname version directory names, to try
  to better match the relevant parameters and reduce the number of
  perl_interpreters required.
There is no check for the existence of a libperl.so for CMISS_PERL when
determining whether to use CMISS_PERL for a SHARED_PERL_EXECUTABLE, as
libperl.so is not required to build and Debian libperl does not put libperl.so
in $(PERL_ARCHLIB)/CORE but only in /usr/lib (which is checked at run time in
perl_interpreter_dynamic.c).
Use a default CMISS_ROOT if none exists.
When looking for cmiss_perl binary directory if a directory matching the perl executable is not found, try one matching what the perl interpreter was compiled with.
