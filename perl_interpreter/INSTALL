This software is the perl_interpreter for CMISS.
It is released under the Mozilla Public License v1.1

Further information, help pages, a tracker and a wiki is available at 
http://www.cmiss.org/cmgui/

Dependencies:
Required:
Perl: 
bin2base64: Small script that encodes binary files as a base64 string.

Build bin2base64.  It is expected that the resulting executable is located at $(CMISS_ROOT)/utilities/bin/$(BIN_ARCH_DIR)/bin2base64h.  make OPT=true

Build perl_interpreter.
With a standard distribution of perl this perl_interpreter will build against the shared_object library in your installation (libperl.so).  This will require a binarily compatible version to be found on any computer the executable is put onto at runtime.  You can also include a fully static "fallback" interpreter which means that the executable will run even on a computer without perl.  To do this you must have a static perl library (libperl.a), from your distribution or build.

make OPT=true

There is currently no install target as the programs that depend on this library expect to find the library inside the compilation tree.
